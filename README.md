## Moonshine Test App

* Fork the `moonshinetest` app into your Github account.

* Add `gem ‘plugger’` to the `:development` group in the `Gemfile`.

* Download and setup moonshine:

    $ mkdir -p vendor/plugins
    $ cd vendor/plugins
    $ git clone git://github.com/railsmachine/moonshine.git
    $ rm -fr moonshine/.git/
    $ rm moonshine/.gitignore
    $ cd ../..
    $ rails generate moonshine

* Edit `config/database.yml` with production settings. Hint: database host is `localhost` and add a randomly
generated password.

* Edit `config/deploy.rb` with the server’s hostname.

* Edit the `config/moonshine.yml` so that the `:repository:` setting is pointing to your fork of the `moonshinetest` repository.

* Add capistrano to the `:development` group in the `Gemfile`:

    gem ‘capistrano’, ‘~> 2.15’

* Add the following to `config/application.rb` to prevent the moonshine manifests from being loaded by the app:

    # don't attempt to auto-require the moonshine manifests into the rails env
    # config.paths.app.manifests 'app/manifests', :eager_load => false
    path_rejector = lambda { |s| s.include?("app/manifests") }
    config.eager_load_paths = config.eager_load_paths.reject(&path_rejector)
    # Remove the path from being lazily loaded
    ActiveSupport::Dependencies.autoload_paths.reject!(&path_rejector)

* Commit and push all of your changes to your fork of the repository.

* Deploy setup and deploy the app to the server:

    $ cap deploy:setup
    $ cap deploy

* Ensure that there are no errors in the deploy and if there are fix them. Feel free to ask questions if you get stuck.

* Once the deploy is successful ensure that the app is loading at http://kpm.railsmachine.managedmachine.com

### Bonus: And the moonshine_iptables plugin

Follow the instructions in the README here: https://github.com/railsmachine/moonshine_iptables

NOTE: Moonshine has limited support for Rails 5 so to download the plugin use:

    $ cd vendor/plugins
    $ git clone git://github.com/railsmachine/moonshine_iptables.git
    $ rm -fr moonshine_iptables/.git/
    $ cd ../..

Then follow the remaining instructions from the README.
